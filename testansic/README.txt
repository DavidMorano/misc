TESTANSIC

This little programs tells you if you have a new ANSCI compliant compilter or
not. Why might you not have one (you might ask)? You might now have an ANSCI
compliant compilter if it is old and supported the original K&R version of the C
language. Integer conversion rules were different in the original K&R dialect of
the language than they are in the newer ANSCI compliant dialect of the language.
